| Download blocked by browser | High | üîç To Test | Test with extension loaded |
| URL resolution fails | Medium | üîç To Test | Verify implementation |
| File system permissions | Medium | üîç To Test | Test in real environment |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Load Chrome Extension**:
   - Install the built extension from `/extension.chrome/build/`
   - Verify manifest.json configuration
   - Check for required permissions

2. **Execute Download Tests**:
   - Test download button appearance
   - Verify click-to-download flow
   - Confirm file saves locally
   - Test various image formats

3. **Error Scenario Testing**:
   - Network disconnection
   - Invalid image URLs
   - Permission denied scenarios

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Multiple simultaneous downloads
   - Large image files
   - Memory usage monitoring

### Test Environment Requirements

To complete testing, the following is needed:
1. Chrome browser with extension loaded
2. File system write permissions
3. Network connectivity for image downloads
4. Test images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Load extension and test core download functionality
2. **Medium Priority**: Implement E2E automated tests using Playwright
3. **Low Priority**: Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Quality Gate Status

‚ùå **Not Ready for Release** - Core functionality testing incomplete

### Criteria Not Met:
- [ ] Download functionality not tested
- [ ] Error handling not verified
- [ ] Integration points not validated
- [ ] No automated test coverage

### Next Quality Gate Review
Schedule after completing download functionality tests with loaded extension.
