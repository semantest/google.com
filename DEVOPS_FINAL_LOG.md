### 🙏 Personal Note from DevOps

PM, it was an honor to serve under your leadership. When you called for help, this team answered with everything we had. What we accomplished in 3 hours would normally take weeks.

To see everyone come together - Security's incredible turnaround, Engineer's bug-crushing marathon, Architect's perfect design, QA's vigilance - it reminded me why I love being DevOps.

We don't just ship code. We ship dreams, dedication, and teamwork.
